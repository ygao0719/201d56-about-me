# 201d56-about-me
On this new update, I add some new features:
1. Top ten places I want to visit.
2. ask the user my favorite number.
3. ask the user to guess a country that I have lived in besides U.S. 
4. keep a tally of the total number of correct answers given by the user.

UPDATE on 29 March 2019 for Lab 04, Pair Programming: More extensions to About Me.
The driver on my code is Anthony Berry. The navigator is Yuan Gao. We are pair programming the javascript together.
